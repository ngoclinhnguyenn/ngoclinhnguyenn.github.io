								I collaborated across product, design, and engineering teams to define product requirements and develop over five core features—including interactive habit tracking, a personalized timetable manager, and a video-based learning module. I also defined key dashboard metrics like total study hours and improvement trends, helping students visualize their progress over time.
								
								To align stakeholders, I created functional proposals and detailed use cases, achieving an 80% satisfaction rate. I also designed intuitive wireframes and Figma prototypes, which drove 75% user satisfaction during demos.

										<h4>Diversity Connected - CRM Implementation Project</h4>
										<p class="lead">Capstone Project</p>
										<p class="text-indent">
											As part of the project team supporting DiversityConnected, a DEI consulting firm, I contributed to the evaluation and scoping of a CRM solution to improve lead tracking, outreach, and sales funnel visibility.

The focus of the project was to assess CRM tools that aligned with the organization’s evolving needs amidst staff reductions and shifting strategic priorities. My role involved gathering business requirements, conducting stakeholder interviews, and supporting the scope definition process through MoSCoW prioritization and gap analysis.

I gained hands-on experience in stakeholder management by facilitating discussions, aligning expectations, and ensuring timely progress toward key milestones. I also developed documentation including the project scope statement, success criteria, and business objectives—ensuring clarity between project goals and technical feasibility.

This project strengthened my ability to translate strategic needs into actionable requirements, manage timelines effectively, and support data-informed decision-making in a consulting context.

										<h4>Student Success Stories</h4>
										<p class="lead">Northeastern Seattle - Career Development & Experiential Learning</p>
										<p class="text-indent">
											Co-op and internship experiences are often seen as stepping stones to a career—but what’s missing is the space for reflection, storytelling, and inspiration. I identified a critical gap: while students gain invaluable skills during their co-ops, these experiences are rarely captured beyond resumes or LinkedIn updates. To shift the perception from transactional to transformational, I envisioned and led the creation of Experiential Learning: Success Stories—a dynamic storytelling platform on the Northeastern Seattle Career Services website. This initiative amplifies student voices, showcases diverse career journeys, and highlights the personal and professional growth that happens behind the scenes.

											The project blends storytelling with strategy. I conducted student interviews, gathered insights, and designed an interactive experience that includes a global footprint map showcasing where co-op students have worked across industries and countries. Each featured story invites the Northeastern community to reflect, connect, and celebrate the impact of experiential learning. This isn’t just a webpage—it’s a narrative archive that transforms data into meaning, and moments into momentum.

										<h4>Neural Network Drone</h4>
										<p class="lead">Personal Project</p>
										<p class="text-indent">
											Using two webcams attached to a Raspberry Pi
											controlled RC car, I wrote a
											python program implementing OpenCV, numPy, and
											PyBrain to train a
											back-propagating neural network that can detect
											obstacles and control the
											vehicle.
											Using stereoscopic cameras, the difference between
											each image was used to
											discern obstacles in front of the vehicle. By
											training a neural network to
											transform a left image to a right image, the
											difference between a
											transformed right image and an image from the right
											camera would
											approximately determine the location of the
											obstacle.
										</p>
										<p>
											This project took inspiration from a CMU graduate
											study using a simple
											neural network for obstacle detection with a similar
											stereoscopic camera
											setup.
										</p>
										<p>Find my github repo for this project <a
												href="https://github.com/nahtonaj/neuralnetworkdrone">here</a>!

											online sources and spent a
											lot of time messing around with code to learn about

										<h4>Juul.io</h4>
										<p class="lead">BigRed\\Hacks 2019 Hardware Hack Winner
										</p>
										<p class="text-indent">
											Recent news headlines have brought to light the
											growing teenage vaping
											epidemic. The uncontrolled usage of addictive
											nicotine e-cigarettes has
											flocked the country, with companies like Juul
											focusing advertising on
											younger audiences. Especially on college campuses,
											nicotine addiction is
											becoming ever more prevalent. Juul.io is a solution
											to curb and reduce
											nicotine addiction by allowing Juul users to better
											understand their
											e-cigarette usage by tracking it in real time. It
											would also collect and
											distribute crucial health data (that Juul itself has
											been reluctant to
											provide) about a relatively new, niche, and unknown
											market leading to more
											accurate treatments and behavior predictions.
										</p>
										<p>
											With a team of 3, <a href="https://nicoleslin.github.io">Nicole
												Lin</a>,
											Annie Kimmel, and I worked on making an IoT
											adapter for the popular e-cigarette product Juul.
											The adapter measures the
											amount of current drawn from the device and can
											collect usage data. By
											providing users with data on their habits, users
											become more aware of how
											much nicotine they are ingesting. This provides both
											a platform for IoT
											driven plans for quitting nicotine addiction and a
											way for users to track

									Hi! I'm Linh </h2>
								<p>
									I help elevate businesses and entrepreneurs by transforming data into
									meaningful digital experiences—where business analysis
									meets visionary project leadership.

								</p>
								With a background spanning business analysis, program/project maangement, event
								coordination, and marketing, I bring an interdisciplinary
								approach to every project. Whether it’s developing B2C applications, optimizing
								forecasting dashboards, or leading
								cross-functional initiatives, I love turning ideas into impactful solutions. Right now,
								I’m particularly interested in
								roles that allow me to <b></b>blend product strategy, data insights, and user
								experience—helping teams build meaningful,
								user-centric solutions.<b></b>


								<p>
									I am disciplined and hard-working, ambitious and driven, and
									curious to learn
									all I can. I thrive in challenging and rapid work
									environments - places where I
									learn from mistakes and adapt to improve.
								</p>
								<p>

								</p>
								<p>
									In my spare time, I enjoy working out, coffee hopping and making fitness and
									lifestyle digital content.
								</p>
